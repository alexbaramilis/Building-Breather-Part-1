# Building Breather (Part 1)

Breather is an open-source demo iOS app that shows the weather, air pollution and asthma conditions around you.
I'm building the app and writing a Medium series to raise awareness about air pollution 
and practice some of the latest knowledge I gain about iOS, Swift and programming.

This repo accompanies the Medium articles:
- [Intro: APIs, air pollution & global health, and design.](https://medium.com/@alexandrosbaramilis/building-breather-intro-apis-air-pollution-and-global-health-design-d5aa2b172876)
- [Part 1: Building a responsive UI for any screen in Storyboard.](https://medium.com/@alexandrosbaramilis/building-breather-part-1-building-a-responsive-ui-for-any-screen-in-storyboard-b2bfa9b6a875)
- [Part 1 - Bonus: Populating the UI with sample data, namespacing with enums and formatting the data with Swift Extensions.](https://medium.com/@alexandrosbaramilis/building-breather-part-1-bonus-populating-the-ui-with-sample-data-namespacing-with-enums-and-78f1a7f80f60)
